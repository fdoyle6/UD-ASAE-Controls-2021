# Ground_Station

This directory holds all of the files needed to run the ground station and gui. This, also, contains pictures artifacted from originally having a GPS Module on the main plane. Since, this has been scrapped, and the code functions without the GPS sending data, but we have not cleaned out the pictures. 

Need to install PyQt5 and PyQt5 Designer
Prob need to play around with numbers to get to fit screen.
