The README for the DAS System on the main plane. 

**Using the DAS**
To run the existing code on the DAS, just plug in one of the microLiPo batteries
into the battery wire coming out of the DAS. This should automatically run the
last program compiled on it, which will probably be the final code we used.


**Programming the DAS**
To program the DAS, we have been using the Arduino IDE. 

First to get this working download and install the IDE, found here
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Next, follow the instructions at the link below to be able to compile, upload,
and run different code on the feather.
