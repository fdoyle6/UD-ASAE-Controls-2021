# UD-ASAE-Controls-2021
The programs written by the Controls Team for the UD ASAE Advanced Class Plane for the 2021-2022 school year. The team captain is Frank Doyle (myself) and the team members are Chris Czerwinski, Michael Rosen, and Jack Swift. This project was our capstone project, and we were tasked with building an RC plane for the ASAE competition in the spring that met specific physical requirements and could accomplish pre-assigned tasks. Our team, working alongside Isabella Mawry's Fuselage Team and Hannah Wiswell's Wings Team, designed, built, and tested this plane. For more details on each topic mentioned, please see below.
