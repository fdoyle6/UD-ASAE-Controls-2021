# UD-ASAE-Controls-2021
This repository contains all of the programs and code written by the Controls Team for the UD ASAE Advanced Class Plane for the 2021-2022 school year. The team captain is Frank Doyle (myself) and the team members are Chris Czerwinski, Michael Rosen, and Jack Swift. This project was our capstone project, and we were tasked with building an RC plane for the ASAE competition in the spring that met specific physical requirements and could accomplish pre-assigned tasks. Our team, working alongside Isabella Mawry's Fuselage Team and Hannah Wiswell's Wings Team, designed, built, and tested this plane. For more details on each topic mentioned, please see below.

## Plane Requirements
The competion goal of this plane is to help firefighters that are working on the ground fight fires. To this end, we were required to maximize the static carrying capacity of the plane, while also releasing an autonomous drone in-flight, which is to land in a circle at an undisclosed location on the field. These goals, as well as requirements for telemetry recording and playback and 750 Watt maximum power draw for the propulsion and power loop, were the key driving forces in our design. For a more detailed description of the rules, requirements and goals of the competition, please see the document [SAE_AeroDesign_2022_Rules.pdf](https://github.com/fdoyle6/UD-ASAE-Controls-2021/blob/main/SAE_AeroDesign_2022_Rules.pdf).
